# Utils

Folder destined to store utility functions that are used in the project. Things such as:
- Time series manipulation (such as separating time series into windows, based on a window size and gap)
- Data manipulation (such as normalizing data, splitting data into train and test sets)
- Defining interfaces for models (such as defining the input and output shapes of a model)

The idea is to keep the code organized and easy to maintain. Things i was doing a lot of times and wanted to just import a function to do it.
